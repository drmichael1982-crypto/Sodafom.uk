# Archie improvement handoff

Read the latest note first and recheck GitHub/CI/deployment before work.

1. [Grown-up unlock announcement — 8 October 2026](2026-10-08-grown-up-unlock-announcement.md): makes the focused unlock confirmation explicitly announce that the area opened and verifies focus in the full browser journey.
2. [Pager status announcement — 8 October 2026](2026-10-08-pager-status-announcement.md): gives shared paged screens explicit polite `Screen N of M` announcements while keeping the visual layout unchanged.
3. [Teacher puzzle subject/year grouping — 8 October 2026](2026-10-08-teacher-puzzle-grouping.md): groups local History/Fraction completions without guessing missing years or introducing pupil/cloud tracking.
4. [Teacher jigsaw reporting — 8 October 2026](2026-10-08-teacher-jigsaw-reporting.md): adds a local-only teacher view of the existing History/Fraction completion records and expands browser/visual coverage.
5. [History and fraction jigsaw progress — 7 October 2026](2026-10-07-history-fractions-progress.md): reconciles the live 26-piece space home, aligns early fraction circles to Years 1–2, adds pause/resume and saves completed jigsaws to grown-up progress; 832 unit tests pass locally.
6. [Reward contrast and compact navigation — 7 October 2026](2026-10-07-reward-contrast-and-compact-navigation.md): reconciled through live test lineage `61146b7`; fixes shared reward contrast, restores compact-home controls/routes and keeps completion navigation visible; 828 unit tests, 550 responsive checks and 68 simulated journeys.
7. [Bingo feedback and breaks — 7 October 2026](2026-10-07-bingo-feedback.md): accurate first-try scoring, hints, pause/resume and prior-run evidence.
8. [Game access — 7 October 2026](2026-10-07-game-access.md): preceding freeze/age-discovery repair and historical starting evidence.

Continue `improve/archie-learning-20261007`, draft PR #81, targeting `test/archie-2026-10-02`. The latest observed test deployment is `f254a44`; candidate pushes do not imply deployment.

Next bounded priority: perform a physical-device keyboard and screen-reader review of the grown-up Teacher flow, then fix only reproduced focus-order or announcement defects. Keep Leonard's separate queue isolated; do not overwrite concurrent changes or merge/deploy.
